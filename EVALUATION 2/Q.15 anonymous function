//anonymous function
Anonymous Function is a function that does not have any name associated with it.
  * Normally we use the function keyword before the function name to define a function in JavaScript,
  * however, in anonymous functions in JavaScript, we use only the function keyword without the function name.

//use
Anonymous functions are often arguments being passed to higher-order functions or used for constructing the result of a higher-order function that needs to return a function. 
If the function is only used once, or a limited number of times, an anonymous function may be syntactically lighter than using a named function.

//need
The advantage of an anonymous function is that it does not have to be stored in a separate file.
This can greatly simplify programs, as often calculations are very simple and the use of anonymous functions reduces the number of code files necessary for a program.
