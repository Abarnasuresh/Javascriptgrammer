The strict mode is a feature available since ECMAScript 5 that allows you to place
your entire program, or an isolated scope, in a ”strict” operating context. This
strict context prevents certain actions from being taken and throws an exception.
*Cannot undeclared variables
*Cannot delete variables
*Cannot declare globally
“use strict”;
var v=3;
delete y;
